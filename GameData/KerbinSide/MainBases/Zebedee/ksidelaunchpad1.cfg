			LaunchSiteDescription = The Zebedee Polar Launch Facility is a medium sized complex located near Kerbin's North Pole. It is essential for craft with a polar orbiting destination in mind. However, its position far from the equator impedes its ability to launch vehicles bound for an equatorial or low inclination orbit.
