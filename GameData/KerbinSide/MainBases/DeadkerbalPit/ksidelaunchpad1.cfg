			LaunchSiteDescription = Located in a range of extinct volcanoes on the edge of Kerbin's Greater Desert, the appropriately named Deadkerbal Pit is the site of development of a new rocket launching facility where a number of fatal accidents has delayed further construction indefinitely. The launch platform is in active service, however, although many kerbonauts feel that any mission slated to launch from the site is cursed to fail.
